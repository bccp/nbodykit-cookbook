The Cookbook
============

Here, we provide a set of recipes detailing a broad selection of the
functionality available in nbodykit. Ranging from simple tasks to
more complex work flows, we hope that these recipes help users become acclimated
with nbodykit as well as illustrate the power of nbodykit for large-scale
structure data analysis.

.. note::

    The recipes are provided as `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter-notebook.rtfd.io>`_.
    Each notebook is available for download by clicking the "Source" link
    in the navigation bar at the top of the page.
